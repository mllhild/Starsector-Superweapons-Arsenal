## Mod description (by Mira)
After playing Starsector for a while I noticed that there is not much excitement over finding weapons in this game (with the exception of end game missions), so I went ahead and created a subset of weapons that are balanced above the level of base weapons, hopefully to give a sense of satisfaction when found.

Reading is for nerds.


## How to get the weapons
- You may find any of these weapons while exploring the outer worlds, mainly in a weapon cache, mining base or a research station.
- Techmining can get you all besides Syndicate and Legendary weapons (Preferebly Vast Ruins)
- You will be offered bounties for a chance to recover Superweapons after beating their current owner in battle (Require Vayra's Sector)
- [Slightly better Techmining](https://www.patreon.com/posts/0-98a-mod-125459046) mod helps with finding weapons
- it's not possible to attain blueprints for any of these weapons, also they won't be used by any faction
