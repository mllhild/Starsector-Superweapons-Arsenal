_Mod description_
After playing Starsector for a while i noticed that there is not much excitement over finding weapons in this game (with the exception of end game missions), so i went ahead and created a subset of weapons that are balanced above the level of base weapons, hopefully to give a sense of satisfaction when found.

Fix 003 : fix last bounty causing saving error. save compatible but if already you accept bounty you must reset the bounty to fix broken flagship captain personality.
Fix 002 : fix EM Railgun and Lighting Gun not hitting. Save compatible.
